## Prompt

/sp.plan me react use nh krna bs Docuaurs se bani hai ui ye b add krna sab me

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan (`specs/001-add-physical-ai-chapter/plan.md`), research findings (`research.md`), data model (`data-model.md`), feature specification (`spec.md`), and requirements checklist (`requirements.md`) have been revised to reflect the user's latest instruction: strictly adhere to Docusaurus defaults for the UI and remove all mentions of a 3D UI.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implementation plan, research, data model, and spec revised to align with new user instruction (no 3D UI, Docusaurus defaults only).
- 🧪 Tests: No tests executed during plan revision.
- 📁 Files: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, spec.md, requirements.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully handled user contradiction and updated all relevant planning artifacts. Emphasized strict adherence to Docusaurus defaults and removal of 3D UI.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during this step.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: Ensure consistency in user instructions.
