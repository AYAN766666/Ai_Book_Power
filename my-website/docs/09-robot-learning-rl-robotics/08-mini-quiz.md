1.  What is the primary goal of an agent in Reinforcement Learning?
    a) To find hidden patterns in data.
    b) To classify inputs into predefined categories.
    c) **To maximize the cumulative reward received from the environment.**
    d) To predict the next state given an action.

2.  In an RL system, what is the role of the "policy"?
    a) It provides a scalar feedback signal to the agent.
    b) It describes the physical boundaries of the environment.
    c) **It defines the agent's behavior by mapping states to actions.**
    d) It estimates the long-term value of a state.

3.  Which of the following is NOT a core component of a Reinforcement Learning system?
    a) Agent
    b) Environment
    c) Reward
    d) **Labeled Dataset**

4.  The dilemma of choosing between taking known rewarding actions and trying out new actions to discover potentially better rewards is known as:
    a) Model-based vs. Model-free.
    b) Policy Gradient vs. Value-based.
    c) **Exploration vs. Exploitation.**
    d) Discrete vs. Continuous.

5.  What is the main reason Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is particularly effective for robotics tasks involving raw sensor data like camera images?
    a) DRL is simpler to implement than traditional RL.
    b) DRL algorithms are always faster to train.
    c) **Deep neural networks can effectively handle high-dimensional state spaces.**
    d) DRL eliminates the need for any reward function.
