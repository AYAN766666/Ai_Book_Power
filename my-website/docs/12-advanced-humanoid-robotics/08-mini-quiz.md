1.  What is a key challenge for bipedal locomotion in humanoid robots?
    a) High energy efficiency compared to wheeled robots.
    b) Simplicity of control due to its human-like form.
    c) **Inherent instability with a small support base and high center of gravity.**
    d) Lack of need for dynamic balance.

2.  During the "single support phase" of bipedal locomotion, what condition might the robot experience that makes control more challenging?
    a) Over-actuation
    b) **Under-actuation**
    c) Perfect static balance
    d) Constant velocity

3.  Which control strategy for humanoid robots coordinates all joints and limbs to achieve multiple, often competing, objectives simultaneously?
    a) ZMP-Based Control
    b) **Whole-Body Control (WBC)**
    c) Model Predictive Control (MPC) (when only applied to a single task)
    d) Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control (for a single joint)

4.  The ability of a bipedal robot to maintain its equilibrium while it is in motion is known as:
    a) Static Balancing
    b) **Dynamic Balancing**
    c) Gait Generation
    d) Whole-Body Kinematics

5.  What is the key distinguishing feature of a "flight phase" in bipedal locomotion?
    a) One foot is always in contact with the ground.
    b) The robot is moving at its slowest speed.
    c) **Both feet are simultaneously off the ground.**
    d) The robot is using its arms for support.
