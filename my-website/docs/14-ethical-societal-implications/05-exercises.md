# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 14: Ethical and Societal Implications of Physical AI. Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **AI-Powered Surveillance Robot in Public Spaces**:
    Imagine a fully autonomous robot equipped with advanced sensors (cameras, microphones, facial recognition) patrolling public spaces (e.g., a city square, airport) for security purposes.
    a) Discuss the significant ethical concerns related to privacy and surveillance that such a robot would raise.
    b) What mitigation strategies (design, policy, technical) would you propose to address these concerns, balancing security needs with individual rights?
    c) How would the concept of "contextual privacy" apply to this scenario, and what challenges does it present for designing ethical operation protocols?

2.  **Job Transformation vs. Displacement by Industrial Robots**:
    In a fully automated factory, industrial robots perform complex assembly tasks that were previously done by human workers.
    a) Discuss the potential for both job displacement and job creation/augmentation in such a scenario. Provide specific examples of new roles or transformed existing roles.
    b) What societal policies or corporate strategies (e.g., retraining programs, investment in new industries) could help mitigate the negative impacts of job displacement and ensure a just transition for the workforce?

3.  **Accountability and Decision-Making in Autonomous Vehicles**:
    A fully autonomous vehicle (AV) is involved in an unavoidable accident, where it must choose between two outcomes, both involving harm:
    *   Option A: Swerve and injure its occupant.
    *   Option B: Continue straight and injure a pedestrian.
    a) Discuss the ethical dilemma this scenario presents for the AV's decision-making algorithm. What ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology) might be applied, and what are their challenges in this context?
    b) Beyond the immediate decision, who would be held accountable for the outcome of such an accident (e.g., AV manufacturer, software developer, vehicle owner, regulatory body)? Explain the complexities of assigning accountability in physical AI systems.
