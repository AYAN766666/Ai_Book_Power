# Chapter 13: Digital Twins and Simulation-to-Real Transfer

Welcome to Chapter 13 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter explores the powerful concepts of digital twins and simulation-to-real (sim-to-real) transfer, which are becoming increasingly vital for the development, testing, and deployment of complex physical AI systems. These approaches leverage the benefits of virtual environments to accelerate learning and development, while addressing the challenges of bridging the gap between simulated and real-world performance.
