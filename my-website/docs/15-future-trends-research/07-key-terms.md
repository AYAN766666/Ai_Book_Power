# Key Terms

This section provides definitions for important terms introduced in Chapter 15: Future Trends and Research Directions. Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping the cutting-edge advancements and potential future of physical AI.

---

*   **Embodied AI (Advanced)**: The concept that intelligence is deeply intertwined with a physical body and its interactions with the world, extending to novel forms of embodiment, adaptive morphology, and self-organizing physical systems.
*   **Morphological Computation**: The idea that the physical design and properties of a robot's body itself contribute to computation and control, reducing the need for complex software.
*   **Adaptive Morphology**: Robots that can change their shape, size, or material properties to adapt to different tasks or environments.
*   **Hyper-Sensing**: The development of multi-modal, highly sensitive, and distributed sensor networks embedded throughout a robot's body for richer perception.
*   **Proprioceptive Revolution**: Refers to the development of ultra-sensitive internal sensors that give robots an unprecedented understanding of their own body state.
*   **Artificial Muscles**: Novel actuators (e.g., soft actuators, electroactive polymers) that mimic biological muscle contractions, offering human-like compliance, power, and dexterity.
*   **Self-Organization (Robotics)**: The ability of robots to autonomously assemble themselves from simpler components or form complex structures through collective interaction.
*   **Self-Healing and Self-Repair (Robotics)**: Robots that can detect damage, diagnose the problem, and physically repair themselves, inspired by biological systems.
*   **Bio-Integration**: The integration of biological and artificial components, where robots might interact directly with living systems or incorporate biological elements.
*   **Cyborg-Robotics**: A concept where human and robot elements are merged, often through advanced prosthetics or direct neural interfaces.
*   **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: A direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device (e.g., a robot), allowing control through thought alone.
*   **Neural-Robotics**: An interdisciplinary field combining neuroscience, robotics, and AI to understand the brain's control principles and apply them to robots, or to create hybrid biological-robotic systems.
*   **Hybrid Intelligence**: Systems that combine human and artificial intelligence, leveraging the strengths of both for co-evolution and co-adaptation.
*   **Distributed Cognition (Robotics)**: The concept that intelligence is not localized in a single "brain" but is distributed across the physical bodies, sensors, and actuators of a collective, emerging from their interactions.
*   **Soft Robotics**: A field focused on constructing robots from compliant, deformable materials rather than rigid components, enabling adaptability, safety, and novel manipulation.
*   **Bio-Inspired Design (Biomimicry)**: An approach to engineering that draws inspiration from natural solutions found in biological systems to solve complex problems in robotics (e.g., for locomotion, manipulation, sensing).
*   **Gait Generation (Bio-Inspired)**: The process of creating walking or movement patterns in robots inspired by animal or human locomotion.
*   **Bio-Inspired Grippers**: Robotic grippers whose design and function are inspired by biological grasping mechanisms (e.g., gecko adhesion, elephant trunks).
*   **Edge AI (Robotics)**: Deploying AI processing capabilities closer to the data source (sensors and actuators) on the robot itself, rather than relying solely on cloud computing, for faster, more efficient decision-making.
*   **Human Augmentation**: The use of technology to enhance human capabilities, often seen as a goal of advanced physical AI and robotics.
