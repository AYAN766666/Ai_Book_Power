1.  What is "morphological computation" in the context of future embodied AI?
    a) The use of advanced algorithms to optimize robot shape.
    b) **The idea that the physical design of a robot's body itself contributes to computation and control.**
    c) Robots that can change their color based on their environment.
    d) Robots that can only operate in virtual environments.

2.  Which characteristic is central to "soft robotics"?
    a) High rigidity and power.
    b) Exclusive use of electric motors.
    c) **Construction from compliant, deformable materials.**
    d) Complete isolation from human interaction.

3.  "Bio-inspired design" (or biomimicry) primarily involves:
    a) Creating robots that look exactly like animals.
    b) Programming robots with biological algorithms.
    c) **Observing and mimicking solutions found in nature to solve engineering problems.**
    d) Integrating living biological components into robots.

4.  What cutting-edge technology allows for direct communication between the human brain and external devices like robots, enabling control through thought alone?
    a) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    b) Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
    c) **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**
    d) Cognitive Architectures

5.  What is the main benefit of the synergy between soft robotics and bio-inspired design?
    a) It makes robots less adaptable to new environments.
    b) It simplifies the manufacturing process for all robots.
    c) **It leads to robots that are inherently adaptive, resilient, and safe for interaction in complex, dynamic worlds.**
    d) It reduces the need for any sensors in robot design.
