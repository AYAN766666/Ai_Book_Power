# Chapter 09: Robot Learning: Reinforcement Learning in Robotics

Welcome to Chapter 09 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter dives into the exciting field of robot learning, with a particular focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a powerful paradigm that allows robots to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This approach is revolutionizing how robots acquire complex skills, moving beyond explicit programming to adaptive and intelligent behaviors.
