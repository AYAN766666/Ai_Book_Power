# Chapter 10: Computer Vision for Robotics

Welcome to Chapter 10 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter explores the crucial role of computer vision in enabling robots to perceive and understand their environment. Computer vision provides robots with the ability to "see" and interpret visual information, which is fundamental for tasks such as object recognition, localization, navigation, and manipulation. We will delve into key computer vision techniques and their specific applications in robotics, highlighting how visual data fuels intelligent physical interaction.
