# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 11: Artificial Intelligence in Robotics: Advanced Topics. Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **Cognitive Robot for Search and Rescue**:
    Imagine a cognitive robot designed for urban search and rescue operations in a partially collapsed building.
    a) What types of knowledge would this robot need to represent (e.g., about the environment, tasks, objects, victims)? How might this knowledge be represented (e.g., semantic maps, ontologies, symbolic facts)?
    b) Describe how this robot would utilize reasoning mechanisms (e.g., logical, probabilistic planning) to:
        *   Infer the location of potential victims given partial sensor data.
        *   Plan a safe path through debris to reach a known victim.
        *   Prioritize tasks (e.g., rescue vs. exploration).

2.  **Multi-Robot System for Environmental Monitoring**:
    You are deploying a fleet of small, autonomous drones to monitor a large agricultural field for crop health.
    a) Discuss the advantages of using a multi-robot system (specifically a decentralized or swarm intelligence approach) over a single, more capable drone for this task.
    b) What communication and coordination challenges would this multi-drone system face? How might the drones use local interactions to achieve global monitoring objectives (e.g., ensuring full coverage without overlap)?

3.  **LfD for Human-Robot Collaboration in Assembly**:
    Consider a human worker teaching a collaborative robot (cobot) a new assembly sub-task, such as inserting a delicate component.
    a) What are the benefits of using Learning from Demonstration (LfD) for this task compared to traditional programming?
    b) Describe how kinesthetic teaching could be used to demonstrate this task. What data would be recorded, and what features would be extracted?
    c) Discuss how the learned policy from the demonstration might need to be generalized or adapted if the component's starting position slightly varies in subsequent assembly cycles.
