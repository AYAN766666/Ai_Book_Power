# Chapter 06: Robot Navigation and Mapping

Welcome to Chapter 06 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter explores the critical abilities that allow autonomous robots to move intelligently through their environments: navigation and mapping. We will delve into how robots perceive their surroundings, build internal representations of space, localize themselves within those representations, and plan paths to reach desired goals while avoiding obstacles.
