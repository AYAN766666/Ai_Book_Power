# Chapter 13: Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques

One of the biggest challenges in robotics is bridging the gap between simulation and the real world – the "sim-to-real" problem. This chapter explores various techniques for successful sim-to-real transfer, including domain randomization, adaptive control, and transfer learning. We will examine how to effectively train AI models in simulation and deploy them on physical robots with minimal performance degradation.
