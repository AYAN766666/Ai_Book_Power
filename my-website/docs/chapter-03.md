# Chapter 03: Actuators and Mechanisms

Welcome to Chapter 03 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter delves into the fundamental components that enable robots to move and interact with their environment: actuators and the mechanisms they drive. You will learn about different types of actuators, their operating principles, and how they are integrated into robotic systems to achieve desired movements and forces.
