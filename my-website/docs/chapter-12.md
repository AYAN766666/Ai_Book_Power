# Chapter 12: Advanced Humanoid Robotics: Locomotion and Dexterity

Welcome to Chapter 12 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter delves into the advanced challenges and solutions in humanoid robotics, focusing on two of their most critical capabilities: complex locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Building upon foundational kinematics, dynamics, and control, we will explore how humanoids achieve stable walking, running, and dynamic balancing, as well as the intricate mechanisms and control strategies that enable their hands to perform fine motor tasks.
