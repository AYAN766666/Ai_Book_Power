1.  What is a "digital twin"?
    a) A secondary backup robot in case the primary fails.
    b) A robot that can operate in two different environments simultaneously.
    c) **A virtual model reflecting a physical system, updated with real-world data, used for monitoring and analysis.**
    d) A software program that completely replaces a physical robot.

2.  The "reality gap" primarily refers to the discrepancy between:
    a) A robot's ability to communicate with humans and its ability to communicate with other robots.
    b) **The simulated environment and the real physical world.**
    c) The cost of a robot and its perceived value.
    d) The speed of a robot's perception and its action.

3.  Which technique is used to mitigate the reality gap by explicitly randomizing various parameters of the simulation during training, making learned policies more robust?
    a) System Identification
    b) Domain Adaptation
    c) **Domain Randomization**
    d) Direct Real-World Training

4.  What is a key benefit of using robotic simulation for training Reinforcement Learning agents?
    a) It reduces the need for any complex reward functions.
    b) It guarantees that the learned policy will work perfectly in the real world.
    c) **It allows for safe and rapid generation of vast amounts of training data without damaging hardware.**
    d) It eliminates the need for any sensors on the robot.

5.  What is the process of using real-world data from a physical system to learn or refine the parameters of its mathematical model, often used to make simulations more accurate?
    a) Domain Randomization
    b) **System Identification**
    c) Policy Fine-tuning
    d) Curriculum Learning
