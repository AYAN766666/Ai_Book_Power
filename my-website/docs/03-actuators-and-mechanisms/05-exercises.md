# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 03: Actuators and Mechanisms. Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **Actuator Selection for a Robotic Gripper**:
    You are designing a robotic gripper for a task that involves picking up both fragile items (e.g., glassware) and sturdy items (e.g., metal parts) from an assembly line. The gripper needs to operate quickly but also provide precise force control to avoid damaging delicate objects. Discuss the pros and cons of using electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic actuators for this specific application. Which type would you choose and why, considering the trade-offs in precision, speed, force, and safety?

2.  **Impact of Backlash on Robot Performance**:
    Explain what "backlash" is in the context of a gear train and how it can negatively impact the performance of a robotic arm, particularly for tasks requiring high precision or repetitive movements (e.g., surgical robotics, precise assembly). What design considerations or control strategies can be employed to mitigate the effects of backlash?

3.  **Gear Ratio Design Challenge**:
    A small mobile robot needs to climb a steep ramp. Its motor provides a maximum speed of 5000 RPM and a maximum torque of 0.1 Nm. The robot requires at least 2 Nm of torque at its wheels to climb the ramp. Assuming a gearbox efficiency of 85%, calculate the minimum gear ratio required. What would be the resulting wheel speed if this gear ratio is applied? Discuss any implications of this speed for the robot's overall locomotion.
