# Key Terms

This section provides definitions for important terms introduced in Chapter 03: Actuators and Mechanisms. Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping the components that enable robotic motion.

*   **Actuator**: A component that converts energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) into physical motion or force, enabling a robot to interact with its environment.
*   **DC Motor (Direct Current Motor)**: An electric motor that uses a commutator and brushes to convert electrical energy into continuous rotational motion. Known for simple control.
*   **Brushless DC (BLDC) Motor**: An electric motor that uses electronic commutation instead of brushes and a commutator. Offers higher efficiency, longer lifespan, and precise control.
*   **Stepper Motor**: An electric motor that divides a full rotation into discrete steps, allowing for precise positional control, often without feedback (open-loop).
*   **Hydraulic System**: A power transmission system that uses incompressible fluid (typically oil) under pressure to generate high forces and stiff, precise movements.
*   **Pneumatic System**: A power transmission system that uses compressible gas (typically compressed air) under pressure to generate forces, known for fast response times and clean operation.
*   **Gear Ratio**: The ratio of the number of teeth on the driven gear to the number of teeth on the driving gear in a gear train. It determines the relationship between input and output speed and torque.
*   **Torque**: A rotational force that causes an object to rotate around an axis. Often measured in Newton-meters (Nm).
*   **RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)**: A unit of angular speed, indicating the number of rotations per minute.
*   **Efficiency**: The ratio of useful work output to the total energy input, often expressed as a percentage. In gearboxes, it quantifies energy loss.
*   **Backlash**: The slack or lost motion in a mechanical system, particularly between meshing gears, where there is a small gap that allows for free movement before engaging.
*   **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)**: An electronic circuit used to control the speed and direction of BLDC motors.
*   **FRL Unit**: A combination of Filter, Regulator, and Lubricator used in pneumatic systems to ensure the quality and controlled pressure of compressed air.
*   **Actuator Stiffness**: A measure of how much an actuator resists displacement when a force is applied. High stiffness often implies precise control but can be less forgiving.
*   **Power Density**: The amount of power an actuator can produce relative to its size or weight.
