# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 01: Introduction to Physical AI. Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **Embodied vs. Disembodied AI**:
    Describe the fundamental difference between "Physical AI" (or embodied AI) and "traditional AI" (often considered disembodied). Provide an example of a task where the embodiment of an AI system would be a significant advantage, and explain why.

2.  **Perception-Action Loop in a Specific Context**:
    Consider a robotic arm tasked with picking up a delicate object (e.g., a glass cup) from a table and placing it on a shelf. Describe how the perception-action loop would function in this scenario. Identify at least three types of sensors the arm might use and explain their role in each stage of the loop (perception, decision, action).

3.  **Balancing Strategies and Their Limits**:
    Explain the three primary strategies a humanoid robot might use to maintain balance (ankle, hip, and step strategies). Discuss the conditions under which each strategy would be most appropriate and what factors might limit their effectiveness. How does sensor feedback contribute to the robot's decision-making in choosing a balance strategy?
