# Chapter 6: The Landscape of Robotics Simulators

This chapter provides a survey of the modern robotics simulation ecosystem. We will explore and compare popular simulators such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Gazebo, MuJoCo, and PyBullet. The focus will be on their respective strengths, weaknesses, supported features (like ray tracing and physics engines), and their typical use cases in research and industry.
