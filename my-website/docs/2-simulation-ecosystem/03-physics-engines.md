# Chapter 7: Understanding Physics Engines

The heart of any realistic simulator is its physics engine. This chapter explains how physics engines work, covering concepts like rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and contact modeling. We will discuss the trade-offs between accuracy and performance and how the choice of a physics engine can impact the validity of a simulation.
