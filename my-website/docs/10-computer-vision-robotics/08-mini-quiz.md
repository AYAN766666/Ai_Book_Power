1.  What is the main contribution of computer vision to robotics?
    a) Enhancing the robot's physical strength.
    b) Improving the robot's communication abilities.
    c) **Enabling robots to perceive and interpret visual information from the environment.**
    d) Optimizing the robot's energy consumption.

2.  Which type of camera provides both color (RGB) and depth (D) information simultaneously, making it highly valuable for 3D perception in robotics?
    a) Monocular Camera
    b) Stereo Camera
    c) Event Camera
    d) **RGB-D Camera**

3.  Which image processing technique is particularly effective at removing "salt-and-pepper" noise while also preserving the sharp boundaries of objects?
    a) Gaussian Filter
    b) Sobel Operator
    c) **Median Filter**
    d) Canny Edge Detector

4.  What is the primary difference between object recognition (classification) and object detection?
    a) Object recognition uses deep learning, while object detection uses traditional algorithms.
    b) Object detection is faster than object recognition.
    c) **Object recognition identifies *what* an object is, while object detection identifies *what* it is AND *where* it is.**
    d) Object recognition works only in real-time, while object detection is offline.

5.  What significant limitation does monocular Visual Odometry (VO) face that makes it difficult to determine the true scale of the environment or robot motion?
    a) It is highly sensitive to color variations.
    b) It cannot detect objects at all.
    c) **It suffers from scale ambiguity.**
    d) It is too computationally expensive for real-time use.
