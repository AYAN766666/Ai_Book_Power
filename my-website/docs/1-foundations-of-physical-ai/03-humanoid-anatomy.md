# Chapter 3: The Anatomy of a Humanoid Robot

This chapter provides a detailed look at the mechanical and electrical components that make up a humanoid robot. We will explore different types of actuators (motors), sensors (vision, tactile, proprioceptive), and power systems. The chapter will also cover the structural design of the robotic skeleton and the materials used in modern humanoid engineering.
