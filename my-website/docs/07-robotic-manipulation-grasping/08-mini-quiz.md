1.  What is the primary function of a robot's end-effector?
    a) To power the robot's motors.
    b) To control the robot's navigation.
    c) **To interact with the environment, often by grasping or using tools.**
    d) To process sensor data.

2.  Which type of gripper is best suited for handling delicate and irregularly shaped objects due to its ability to conform to object shapes?
    a) Jawed gripper
    b) Hydraulic gripper
    c) **Soft gripper**
    d) Vacuum gripper

3.  A grasp where the gripper completely encompasses the object's geometry, constraining all its degrees of freedom purely through shape, is known as a:
    a) Force Closure Grasp
    b) Power Grasp
    c) Precision Grasp
    d) **Form Closure Grasp**

4.  Which phase of a pick-and-place task involves identifying the object to be picked up and determining its precise 3D position and orientation?
    a) Grasp Planning
    b) Grasp Execution
    c) **Object Perception and Localization**
    d) Post-Grasp Transport

5.  What is a major advantage of using data-driven (learning-based) approaches for grasp planning?
    a) They provide strong theoretical guarantees of grasp stability.
    b) They are only applicable to objects with known 3D models.
    c) **They can handle novel objects and cluttered scenes effectively.**
    d) They eliminate the need for any sensor feedback.
