# Chapter 9: Control Systems for Humanoid Locomotion

Achieving stable and dynamic locomotion in humanoid robots is a significant engineering feat. This chapter explores various control strategies, including ZMP (Zero Moment Point) control, whole-body control, and reinforcement learning approaches for walking, running, and navigating complex terrains. We will discuss sensor fusion and real-time computation requirements.
