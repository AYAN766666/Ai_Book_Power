# Chapter 10: Bipedal Locomotion and Balance

This chapter focuses on the intricacies of bipedal locomotion, the ability of humanoid robots to walk on two legs. We will delve into the biomechanics of human walking and how these principles are translated into robotic design and control. Topics include gait generation, balance recovery, and managing disturbances while maintaining stability.
