# Chapter 11: Humanoid Manipulation and Interaction

Beyond locomotion, humanoid robots need to interact with their environment through manipulation. This chapter covers the design of robotic hands and grippers, inverse kinematics for arm control, and strategies for object recognition and grasping. We will also touch upon human-robot interaction (HRI) and safety considerations in collaborative tasks.
