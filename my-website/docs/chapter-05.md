# Chapter 05: Robot Control Systems

Welcome to Chapter 05 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter explores the fundamental principles and techniques behind controlling robotic systems. Effective control is what enables robots to perform tasks precisely, safely, and efficiently. We will delve into various control architectures, feedback mechanisms, and common control algorithms that bring robot kinematics and dynamics to life.
