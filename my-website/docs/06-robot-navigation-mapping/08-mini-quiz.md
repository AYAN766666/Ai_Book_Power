1.  What is the primary objective of "localization" in robotics?
    a) To create a map of the environment.
    b) To plan a path from a start to a goal.
    c) **To determine the robot's own position and orientation within a map.**
    d) To avoid obstacles.

2.  Which concept refers to the computational problem of building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within that map?
    a) Mapping
    b) Localization
    c) Path Planning
    d) **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**

3.  In an occupancy grid map, what does a cell with a high probability value (e.g., close to 1) represent?
    a) An unexplored area.
    b) A free space.
    c) **An obstacle.**
    d) The robot's current position.

4.  Which path planning algorithm uses a heuristic function to efficiently guide its search towards the goal, making it an informed search strategy?
    a) Dijkstra's Algorithm
    b) Breadth-First Search
    c) **A* (A-star) Algorithm**
    d) Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)

5.  What is the crucial process in SLAM that identifies when the robot has returned to a previously visited location, used to correct accumulated errors?
    a) Odometry Estimation
    b) Motion Tracking
    c) **Loop Closure**
    d) Data Association
