# Chapter 07: Robotic Manipulation and Grasping

Welcome to Chapter 07 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"! This chapter focuses on robotic manipulation, the ability of robots to interact physically with objects in their environment. We will explore the challenges and techniques involved in grasping, lifting, and manipulating objects, which are essential capabilities for robots performing tasks in factories, homes, and dangerous environments.
