# Key Terms

This section provides definitions for important terms introduced in Chapter 08: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Understanding these terms is crucial for grasping how humans and robots can effectively and safely work together.

---

*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The interdisciplinary study focusing on the design, capabilities, and limitations of the interactions between humans and robots.
*   **Collaborative Robots (Cobots)**: Robots designed to work safely alongside humans in a shared workspace, collaborating on tasks.
*   **Verbal Communication (HRI)**: Exchange of information between humans and robots using spoken language, often involving speech recognition and speech synthesis.
*   **Non-Verbal Communication (HRI)**: Exchange of information through gestures, facial expressions, body language, sounds, lights, or other cues that are not spoken words.
*   **Tangible & Physical Interaction (HRI)**: Direct physical contact and manipulation between humans and robots, such as human guidance or force-compliant responses.
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A visual interface that allows users to interact with robots through graphical icons and visual indicators, often on touchscreens or monitors.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Technology that overlays virtual information onto the physical robot or environment, enhancing human perception and interaction with the robot.
*   **Robot Safety**: The design and operation of robots to prevent physical harm, discomfort, or anxiety to humans, encompassing both physical and psychological aspects.
*   **Emergency Stop (E-Stop)**: A critical safety mechanism that immediately halts all robot motion and power in an emergency situation.
*   **Force/Torque Sensors (HRI context)**: Sensors often integrated into cobots to detect contact forces and limit them to safe levels, protecting human collaborators.
*   **Predictability (HRI)**: The degree to which a robot's future actions and behavior can be anticipated and understood by humans.
*   **Transparency (HRI)**: The ability of a robot to communicate its internal state, intentions, and decision-making process to humans in an understandable way.
*   **Trust (HRI)**: A human's belief that a robot will competently and reliably perform its intended function and act in an acceptable manner.
*   **Trust Miscalibration**: Situations where human trust levels in a robot do not accurately reflect the robot's actual capabilities and limitations (e.g., over-trust or under-trust).
*   **Appropriate Trust**: The ideal state where human trust in a robot is aligned with the robot's actual capabilities and limitations.
*   **Human-Awareness**: A robot's capability to detect, track, and understand human presence, movements, and intentions in its workspace.
*   **Shared Understanding (HRI)**: A common mental model between human and robot regarding task goals, environmental conditions, and respective capabilities.
*   **Social Robotics**: A subfield of robotics that focuses on robots designed to interact with humans on a social and emotional level, often requiring advanced HRI capabilities.
