# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 08: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **HRI Design for a Service Robot in a Hospital**:
    Imagine you are designing a service robot to deliver medicines and supplies within a hospital. This robot will navigate busy corridors, interact with staff and patients (including elderly or children), and potentially operate elevators.
    a) Discuss the critical HRI considerations (safety, communication, trust, etc.) for this robot.
    b) What combination of communication modalities (verbal, non-verbal, tangible, GUI/AR) would you integrate into this robot, and how would each contribute to effective and safe interaction?

2.  **Addressing Trust Miscalibration in Autonomous Vehicles**:
    Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a prime example of physical AI systems where human trust is paramount. Discuss the concepts of "over-trust" and "under-trust" in the context of AVs. Provide examples of how each could lead to dangerous situations. What design strategies or HRI features could be implemented in AVs to foster "appropriate trust" in human occupants and pedestrians?

3.  **Collaborative Robot Task Redesign for Improved HRI**:
    Consider a repetitive industrial assembly task that is currently performed by a human worker and a robot working sequentially (i.e., the human finishes their part, then the robot starts its part). Propose ways to redesign this task to make it a more truly collaborative human-robot interaction using HRI principles. Focus on how communication (implicit and explicit) and safety features could be integrated to improve efficiency, reduce human workload, and enhance human worker satisfaction.
