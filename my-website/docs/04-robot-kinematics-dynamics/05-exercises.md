# Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 04: Robot Kinematics and Dynamics. Think critically and provide comprehensive answers.

## Conceptual Questions

1.  **Kinematics vs. Dynamics in Robotic Tasks**:
    For each of the following robotic tasks, identify whether kinematics or dynamics (or both) would be primarily involved, and briefly explain why:
    a) A robot arm picking up a lightweight object from a conveyor belt.
    b) A humanoid robot performing a complex acrobatic maneuver.
    c) A mobile robot navigating through a static, known environment.
    d) A robot welding a precise seam on a heavy metal component.

2.  **Challenges of Inverse Kinematics in Real-World Robotics**:
    Discuss the practical challenges of implementing inverse kinematics for a multi-jointed robot arm in a real-world scenario. Consider issues such as multiple solutions, singularities, and computational efficiency. How might a robot designer or programmer address these challenges in a practical application?

3.  **Applying DH Parameters (Advanced)**:
    Consider a 3-link robotic arm with two revolute joints and one prismatic joint. The first revolute joint rotates about a vertical axis, the second revolute joint rotates about a horizontal axis, and the prismatic joint extends along the axis of the second revolute joint.
    a) Sketch the robot and assign appropriate coordinate frames according to the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention.
    b) Construct the DH parameter table for this robot.
    c) (Optional, more advanced) Write down the general form of the homogeneous transformation matrix for each link.
